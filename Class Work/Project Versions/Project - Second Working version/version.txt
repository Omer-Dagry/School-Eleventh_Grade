second version of the project with 2 sockets to the client,
one for the thread that calls the sync function all the time and the second for all the other communications with the server


**** FIXED ****
file count was for each chat of each user and if two users were sending a file to the same user it would list them both as 0.end_of_file,
now all the files are starting with the name of the chat that they belong to so insted of 0.end_of_file it will be chatname_0.end_of_file.
